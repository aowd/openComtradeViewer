# openComtradeViewer

An open/free multi platform IEEE COMTRADE oscillograph records visualizer and data extractor.

It's have been successfully tested in GNU/Linux, Microsoft Windows 7 and Mac OS X.

## General Install Guidance

The openComtradeViewer is developed with Python language, version 2.7, so to properly run it will be necessary to have the Python interpreter installed on your computer. Nevertheless, some non-standard libraries will be needed as well. If you run GNU/Linux, Mac OS X or other unix-flavor operating system you probably have Python interpreter installed. However, if you use Microsoft Windows there is a great chance that you will need to [install the interpreter by yourself](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

The non-standard needed libraries are:
- matplotlib
- numpy
- tkinter(*)

(*) Not all GNU/Linux distributions deliver it together with Python interpreter.

On GNU/Linux they can be easily installed with your distribution default package manager, such as apt-get, zypper, dnf, yum, urmpi, etc.

On Microsoft the needed libraries can be easily installed within pip tool.
